# Synopsis

    :- use_module(library(function_expansion)).
    user:function_expansion(incr(N), X, X is N+1).
    main :-
        format('After 2 comes ~p~n', [incr(2)]).

# Description

Prolog doesn't offer function syntax.  Anything one can do with
functions, she can do with predicates. The syntax is a little
verbose because it requires an auxiliary variable.

For example, one might approximate pi:

    pi(3.14159).
    main :-
        pi(Pi),
        format('pi is roughly ~p~n', [Pi]).

It's often obnoxious to think up a name for an auxiliary variable.
function_expansion/3 lets you write macros so that `pi` can be included
directly in format's arguments.  Auxiliary variables are generated for
you at compile time.
